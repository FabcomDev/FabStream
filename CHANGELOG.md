# Changelog

All notable changes to FabStream. Each release on GitHub shows the section of its version.
Format: Added / Improved / Fixed / Known issues.

## 1.1.0 – 2026-10-04

### Added
- Settings → General: confirm before stopping, record automatically when going live, keep the PC awake while live, start with Windows.
- Settings → Hotkeys: start/stop streaming and recording, next/previous scene, mute microphones/desktop audio – in-app or global (also while gaming), with conflict messages.
- Settings → Advanced: process priority for FabStream and its encoders.
- Encoder: CBR/VBR rate control and H.264 profile. Stream: reconnect on/off, attempts and delay. Recording: file name prefix.
- In-app updates: FabStream checks GitHub on every start; "Update & restart" downloads the new version, verifies the Ed25519-signed checksum and the SHA-256, installs it and restarts FabStream.
- Release notes with SHA-256, signed `SHA256SUMS.txt`, SECURITY.md.

### Improved
- Desktop audio: clear message when Windows cannot capture the playback device; audio sources restart automatically when devices change.

### Known issues
- The installer is not code-signed yet: Windows SmartScreen asks for confirmation, and Windows 11 Smart App Control blocks it. The Microsoft Store version is signed by Microsoft.
- Desktop audio is captured from the Windows default playback device; some devices (e.g. game-controller headsets) cannot be captured – choose another output device.
- Multistream sends each destination from your PC, so it needs upload bandwidth for every destination.

## 1.0.0 – 2026-10-04

### Added
- Dual-format studio: one project, two independently designed canvases (16:9 and 9:16), streamed and recorded at the same time.
- Free plan: dual output (one platform per format), recording of both formats, all filters, no watermark, no time limit.
- Premium (optional subscription, 7-day trial in the app): multistream to up to 8 RTMP destinations per format, 3 PCs.
- Hardware encoding (NVIDIA NVENC, AMD AMF, Intel Quick Sync) with automatic x264 fallback.
- Safe-zone overlays for TikTok, Shorts and Reels; GPU video filters; audio mixer with filters.
- Update notice when a new version is published (no automatic download or installation).

### Known issues
- The installer is not code-signed yet: Windows SmartScreen asks for confirmation, and Windows 11 Smart App Control blocks it. The Microsoft Store version is signed by Microsoft.
