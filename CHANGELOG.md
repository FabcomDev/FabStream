# Changelog

All notable changes to FabStream. Each release on GitHub shows the section of its version.
Format: Added / Improved / Fixed / Known issues.

## 1.2.0 – 2026-10-04

### Added
- **Replay buffer & instant clips:** keeps the last 30 s – 10 min of both formats; **Save clip** (button or Ctrl+Shift+C) writes the moment as MP4 – 16:9 and 9:16 at once, instantly, without re-encoding. Configurable seconds before/after.
- **Mark moment** (Ctrl+Shift+M) and a session timeline per stream (events and moments as JSONL next to your recordings).
- **Clip library:** play, show in folder, delete to the recycle bin; Highlight Score per clip.
- Settings → Replay & Clips; Diagnostics → Features (feature flags) and Advanced diagnostics.

- **Application audio:** Audio Mixer → Add Audio → *Application Audio* records a single program – e.g. Discord, Spotify or a game – as its own channel with volume, mute and filters. FabStream lists the programs that are playing sound; programs that are not running yet are picked up automatically when they start (and again after a restart).
- **Desktop Audio → Leave out application:** keep one program (e.g. Discord) out of the desktop mix – so it is not recorded at all, or only through its own fader. Adding an application channel does this automatically, so nothing is recorded twice.
- Settings → Audio → **Desktop audio capture**: Automatic (recommended) / all apps except FabStream / default playback device / legacy.

### Improved
- Buttons in the Outputs panel no longer miss clicks while live statistics update.

### Fixed
- **Desktop audio with headsets and when switching the sound output:** desktop audio is now captured by FabStream's own Windows audio helper. It works with devices Chromium could not open (Logitech G HUB 7.1, DualSense …), keeps running when you switch speakers ↔ headset, re-connects after a device is unplugged, and no longer records FabStream's own monitoring sound. The old capture path remains as an automatic fallback and now re-connects after a device switch too.

### Security
- The app UI can no longer open files directly (folders only); clips open through a checked path.

## 1.1.0 – 2026-10-04

### Added
- Settings → General: confirm before stopping, record automatically when going live, keep the PC awake while live, start with Windows.
- Settings → Hotkeys: start/stop streaming and recording, next/previous scene, mute microphones/desktop audio – in-app or global (also while gaming), with conflict messages.
- Settings → Advanced: process priority for FabStream and its encoders.
- Encoder: CBR/VBR rate control and H.264 profile. Stream: reconnect on/off, attempts and delay. Recording: file name prefix.
- In-app updates: FabStream checks GitHub on every start; "Update & restart" downloads the new version, verifies the Ed25519-signed checksum and the SHA-256, installs it and restarts FabStream.
- Release notes with SHA-256, signed `SHA256SUMS.txt`, SECURITY.md.

### Improved
- Desktop audio: clear message when Windows cannot capture the playback device; audio sources restart automatically when devices change.

### Known issues
- The installer is not code-signed yet: Windows SmartScreen asks for confirmation, and Windows 11 Smart App Control blocks it. The Microsoft Store version is signed by Microsoft.
- Desktop audio is captured from the Windows default playback device; some devices (e.g. game-controller headsets) cannot be captured – choose another output device.
- Multistream sends each destination from your PC, so it needs upload bandwidth for every destination.

## 1.0.0 – 2026-10-04

### Added
- Dual-format studio: one project, two independently designed canvases (16:9 and 9:16), streamed and recorded at the same time.
- Free plan: dual output (one platform per format), recording of both formats, all filters, no watermark, no time limit.
- Premium (optional subscription, 7-day trial in the app): multistream to up to 8 RTMP destinations per format, 3 PCs.
- Hardware encoding (NVIDIA NVENC, AMD AMF, Intel Quick Sync) with automatic x264 fallback.
- Safe-zone overlays for TikTok, Shorts and Reels; GPU video filters; audio mixer with filters.
- Update notice when a new version is published (no automatic download or installation).

### Known issues
- The installer is not code-signed yet: Windows SmartScreen asks for confirmation, and Windows 11 Smart App Control blocks it. The Microsoft Store version is signed by Microsoft.
